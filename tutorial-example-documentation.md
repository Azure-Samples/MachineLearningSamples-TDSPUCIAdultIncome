# Using TDSP Template in Azure Machine Learning Workbench - Prediction of Income Classes from 1994 US Census Data [UCI Adult Income Data]

A few thing to keep in mind while writing this documentation:
1. We no longer call it Tutorial, but **Real World Scenario**. So instead of referring it as "tutorial", use "scenario" or "example" or "sample" interchangeably. 
2. Better to use VSCode (with Acrolinx plugin) for writing the markdown. You need to score above 80/100.  
3. Assume readers have never used Vienna before, so make sure your documentation is clear and easy to follow. 
4. Specify the exact configuration of your machine, compute environment somewhere in the documentation.
5. Given those configurations, how much time in total is expected to finish running the entire tutorial, how much time to run each of the scripts, etc.
6. Any cost concerns the users should be aware of, good to include billing site links. 
7. Include link of the Gallery GitHub repo. If you have not published your Gallery project yet (done by 09/13), put a placeholder of the link for now. 
8. Any script/notebook mentioned in this doc should include links to the Gallery GitHub repo. If you have not published your Gallery project yet (done by 09/13), put a placeholder of the link for now. 
9. If wish to include chunk of codes or commands, follow instructions described in the docs training.


* Link of the Gallery GitHub repository.

If you have not published your Gallery project yet (done by 09/13), put a placeholder of the link for now. 

**The above info will be included in the Readme on GitHub**

## Prerequisites

Please note this section will be included in the Readme file on Gallery GitHub repo.

1. Please make sure that you have properly installed Azure ML Workbench by following the [installation guide](https://github.com/Azure/ViennaDocs/blob/master/Documentation/Installation.md).
2. For operationalization, it is best if you have Docker engine installed and running locally. If not, you can use the cluster option but be aware that running an (ACS) Azure Container Service can be expensive.
3. This tutorial assumes that you are running Azure ML Workbench on Windows 10 with Docker engine locally installed. If you are using macOS the instruction is largely the same.

The above description is purely an example, please tailor it to fit your tutorial.

## Introduction

Please note this section will be included in the Readme file on Gallery GitHub repo.

A brief description on what your sample scenario is about, what users expect to get out of your scenario, what Vienna capabilities your scenario will highlight.

## Use Case Overview

Please note this section will be included in the Readme file on Gallery GitHub repo.

A more detailed description of the use case, business problem, the domain, why it is useful, etc.

## Data Description

Should cover the following points:
* Where is the data
* What is the data structure, what do the columns mean
* Any issue(s) the users should be aware of

## Scenario Structure

Please note a shorter version of this section will be included in the Readme file on Gallery GitHub repo. For the Readme, only include a brief step-by-step instruction with associated script/notebook without going into the details. You can mention something like "For more detailed instructions, please visit the Microsoft DOCS site (include the link to your docs documentation).

At the beginning of this section, please introduce the folder structure of the Gallery GitHub repo that associated with your sample. Here is an example of the [TDSP project repo](https://github.com/hning86/ViennaSample-TDSP) that puts all the codes in the "Code" foler, all the images in the "Images" folder, all the documents (if you have any) in the "Docs" folder, plus one Readme at the root.

In the second part of this section, please describe the step-by-step ML/sample workflow, how the users should follow and use your sample. The workflow proposed below is simply an example, please tailor to fit your own sample:
1. **Data Ingestion & Transformation**
2. **Modeling**
3. **Deployment**
4. **etc**

For each of the above steps of the workflow, please include a description AND point users to the corresponding script or Notebook (name and location). Please also include any important piece of code/function in your script that you would like the users to pay attention to.

In the last part of this section, include the end-to-end workflow architecture diagram. This is **optional** but good to have because it helps users to see the entire picture more clearly. 

## Conclusion & Next Steps

Take home messages, what the users should have learned, call for actions, etc.

## References

If you cite or refer to any external work, please remember to include reference(s) here.
