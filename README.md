## Overview

How to use the Team Data Science Process template to create a project in Azure Machine Learning that classifies US incomes.

For an actual project, the primary Readme.md in the repository would contain an executive summary of the project. In this case, that is located in Microsoft [documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/scenario-tdsp-classifying-us-incomes). It is also available in [project-summary.md](project-summary.md).

## Key components needed to run this scenario
* An Azure [subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com). You can get a [free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?v=17.16&WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=AID559320_SEM_cZGgGOIg) to execute this sample also.
* An [Azure Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) Windows Server 2016](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.windows-data-science-vm), (VM Size: [DS3_V2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes), with 4 virtual CPUs and 14-Gb RAM). Although tested on an Azure DSVM, it is likely to work on any Windows 10 machine.
* This example could be run on local compute context.
