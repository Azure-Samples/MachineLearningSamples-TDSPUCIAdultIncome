Code/02_Model

For each of the sub-tasks under modeling, we have created a sub-folder. In FeatureEngineering and FeatureEngineering sub-folders, have a Main.py and another python file which contains the functions used in Main.py. In the ModelCreation folder, we have one modeling code file, viz. Main_ModelCreation.py. 

For source code files associated with the machine learning model, including folders for:
### Code\Model\01_FeatureEngineering
### Code\Model\02_ModelCreation
### Code\Model\03_FeatureEngineering

For an example of what a modeling report could include, see this in TDSP public GitHub repo [(link)](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-ProjectTemplate/blob/master/Docs/Model/FinalReport.md).
