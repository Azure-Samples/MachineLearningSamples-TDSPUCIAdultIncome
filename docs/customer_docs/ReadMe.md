# /docs/customer_docs

This folder gives us a single point to store documents from the customer related to this engagement. As the repo will become large if you store Word, ppt, etc. files (especially if these are changing over time), please only store final documents here and utilize another location such as a Sharepoint for working documents of that nature.

## Notes:
For this tutorial, dataset information is downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names and saved in the file: .\Docs\CustomerDocs\UCI\_Adult\_Income\_Data\_Information.txt. Typically, for a client data science engagement, there will be documentations provided by the client.
