For deployment in Azure Container Services, you will first have to generate a JSON schema and then have the following three objects in the root directory of your project:
1. JSON schema (generated by Score.py)
2. Model (.pkl file)
3. Score.py Python script

## Operationalization environment setup

Create the environment (you need to do this once per environment e.g. dev or prod)

    az ml env setup -c -n <yourclustername> --location <e.g. eastus2>

Create a Model Management account (one time setup)

    az ml account modelmanagement create --location <e.g. eastus2> -n <your-new-acctname> -g <yourresourcegroupname>

Set the Model Management account

    az ml account modelmanagement set -n <youracctname> -g <yourresourcegroupname>

Set the environment. The cluster name is the name used in step 1 above. The resource group name was the output of the same process and would be in the command window when the setup process is completed.

    az ml env set -n <yourclustername> -g <yourresourcegroupname>

We provide information about each of the files used for deployment. 

## Score.py
    Purpose: generate necessary artifacts (JSON) schema used in operationalization
    Language: Python
    How it gets used: used in deployment
    init: load machine learning model 
    run: >Python Score.py

## How to operationalize
    1. Copy generated model file from previous step to the project root directory
    2. Copy Score.py to the project root directory
    3. Under project root directory, run Score.py to generate service_schema.json
    4. Set up operationalization environment
    5. Run the following command from project root to deploy 
    >az ml service create realtime -f Score.py --model-file CVRandomForestModel.pkl -s service_schema.json -n <app_name> -r python
